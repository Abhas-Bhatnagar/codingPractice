Have Backbone; Disagree and Commit

Sample questions:
Q1: Describe a situation where other members of your team didnâ€™t agree with your ideas. What did you do?
Q2: Tell me about a situation where you had a conflict with someone on your team. What was it about? What did you do? How did they react? What was the outcome?

Eg:-
Breakby discussion ->
    Situation : To do poc for our use cases as well as flow for that feature. But conflict arises because it was not intuitive.
        After evaluating all possible use cases 
            Me -> Complex UI but catters most of the requiremts.
            Sahil sir -> Simple and provide less features.
    Task: Can we do launch some pilot project like in survey form. 
            Target audience ->  Bunisess analyst (specialized users)
                                Normal user.
    Action: Launch that pilot project.
            Analyzed that data.
            Came with mixed approach.
    Result: Premium users were using that complex feature. (visa, STC, Dubai Asset Management)
            Normal users were using simple flow. (Karvy, Sabb, Bupa Arabia, BMW, Vedanta)

    Quantative Metric:: Out of 10 big clients 20%-30% were using that
    Fruitfull byproduct::


Have Backbone; Disagree and Commit

Imp. points 
conflict for ceratin ideas,
then provide possible approaches and try to convience
if that didn't work try to test as a pilot project and try to gather data then show that data points.
Even if it fails I work with him as a best possible manner. Even if we fails we lean and move a head.

Invent and Simplify


Tell me about a time when you invented something.
What improvements have you made at your current company? 
Tell me about a time when you gave a simple solution to a complex problem.




Eg:-
digital_config_table ->
    Situation: Delay in making any new feature live.
    Task: Did a POC to check can we fit data in DB.
    Action: After demostraction we agree and move a head with that approach.
    Result: Just DB. insert queries away to on-board new operator.
    Metric:: 2 weeks to 2-3 days

5. Give an example of when you saw a peer struggling and decided to step in and help. What was the situation and what actions did you take? What was the outcome?


Eg:-
    To code in others repository and get it reviewed & tested with theie team. Saves time.
    Situation: We have to on-board "tata power-mumbai" operator. But gateway team API was not supporting their support.
    Task: Tried to explore their code base and evalte changes and figur out that our team member also worked on the same module past.
    Action: I have taken charge, done code in that repo. 
    Result: Live in a 2 weeks.
